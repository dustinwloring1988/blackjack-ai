## Blackjack AI

Blackjack Reinforcement Learning  This project implements a simple reinforcement learning model to play the game of Blackjack. The model is based on Q-learning and is trained to make optimal decisions during the game.  

## Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).  

### Installation  

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash    git clone https://github.com/your-username/blackjack-reinforcement-learning.git`

3.  Navigate to the project directory:
    
    `cd blackjack-ai`
    
4.  Install the required dependencies:
    
    `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    

Usage
-----

To train the Q-learning model and play the game:

`python blackjack_qlearning.py`

This will train the model and then play a few games.

Training Multiple Models Concurrently
-------------------------------------

To train multiple models concurrently with different parameters:

`python batch_train_qlearning.py`

This script allows you to train multiple models simultaneously with different settings.

Results
-------

The results of the training, including wins, losses, and draws, are saved in the `training_results.csv` file.

Customization
-------------

Feel free to customize the game logic, Q-learning model, and training parameters based on your preferences.

Contributing
------------

Contributions are welcome! If you have any ideas or improvements, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
